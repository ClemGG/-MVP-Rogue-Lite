# Rogue-Lite (MVP)
A Roguelike game made in Unity 2021.1.26f1.

This a proof of concept for a RogueLite as part of a training session. It is not intended to be continued, but this version is playable with a goal and some Rogue-like elements (permadeath, items, enemies, procedural generation, etc.)

The demo is available in the 'Builds' folder.

This is the Minimum Viable Product of this project, made in 2 Months. It contains:
- A Player Character,
- 1 Enemy (using the A* pathfinding algorithm),
- 2 Items,
- An Inspector Log to inspect currently visible Tiles on the Map,
- A Console Log,
- One Map procedurally generated at each level of the dungeon (currently 20 levels),
- 3 different level generation algorithms.

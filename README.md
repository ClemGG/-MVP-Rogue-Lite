# Rogue-Lite (MVP)
A Roguelike game made in Unity 2021.1.26f1.

This a proof of concept for a RogueLite as part of a training session. It is not intended to be continued, but this version is playable with a goal and some Rogue-like elements (permadeath, items, enemies, procedural generation, etc.)

The demo is available in the 'Builds' folder.
